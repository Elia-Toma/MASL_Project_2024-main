# MSL_Project
Design and implement a multiagent system (MAS) using Repast4Py [1]. The MAS will simulate interactions between agents representing various components of the neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative processes in the gut and the brain. These are intended as complex systems interconnected through the gut-brain axis.
